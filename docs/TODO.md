## üìã Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

- Use clear, concise language appropriate for developers
- Include practical examples for every concept
- Start with simple examples, then progress to complex ones
- Always show both the code and the expected output
- Use consistent terminology throughout all docs

### Code Examples

- All Go code should be production-ready and follow best practices
- Include complete, runnable examples where possible
- Show both manual and Taskw-generated approaches for comparison
- Add comments explaining non-obvious parts
- Test all examples before publishing

### Documentation Structure

- Start each page with a brief overview
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Include a "Next Steps" section pointing to related topics
- Add callouts for important warnings or tips
- End complex topics with a summary

## üìù Notes

- **Target Audience**: Go developers familiar with Fiber and basic DI concepts
- **Tone**: Professional but friendly, focusing on practical solutions
- **Update Strategy**: Keep docs in sync with code changes, especially for CLI and config
- **Validation**: Each example should be tested against the latest version of Taskw
