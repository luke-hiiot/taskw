# Welcome to Taskw

**Taskw** is a code generator for Go APIs that automatically generates boilerplate code for **Fiber routes** and **Wire dependency injection** from your annotations and provider functions.

Stop writing repetitive route registration and dependency wiring code. Focus on your business logic instead.
