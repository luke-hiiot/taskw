# taskw clean

Remove all files that were generated by Taskw. This helps clean up the workspace when regenerating code or switching configurations.

## Usage

```bash
taskw clean
```

## Description

The `clean` command removes all files that were generated by Taskw, including:

- **Route Registration Files** - Generated route registration code
- **Dependency Injection Files** - Generated Wire dependency injection code
- **Swagger Documentation Files** - Generated API documentation

This is useful when you want to:
- Start fresh with a new generation
- Switch between different configurations
- Remove generated files from version control
- Debug generation issues

## Examples

### Basic Clean

```bash
taskw clean
```

Example output:

```
🧹 Cleaning generated files...

● Deleted 3 files:
  - routes_gen.go
  - dependencies_gen.go
  - swagger.json

✅ Clean completed successfully
```

### Clean with Missing Files

```bash
taskw clean
```

Example output when some files don't exist:

```
🧹 Cleaning generated files...

● Deleted 2 files:
  - routes_gen.go
  - dependencies_gen.go

• Skipped 1 files (not found):
  - swagger.json

✅ Clean completed successfully
```

### Clean with No Files

```bash
taskw clean
```

Example output when no generated files exist:

```
🧹 Cleaning generated files...

• No generated files found to clean

✅ Clean completed successfully
```

## Files Removed

The clean command removes these types of files:

### Generated Code Files

- `routes_gen.go` - Route registration code
- `dependencies_gen.go` - Wire dependency injection code
- `wire_gen.go` - Generated Wire implementation

### Documentation Files

- `swagger.json` - Swagger API documentation
- `swagger.yaml` - Swagger API documentation (YAML format)

### Configuration-Dependent Files

The exact files removed depend on your `taskw.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
generation:
  routes:
    output_file: "routes_gen.go"      # This file will be removed
  dependencies:
    output_file: "dependencies_gen.go" # This file will be removed
```

## Configuration

The clean command uses the same configuration as the generate command to determine which files to remove:

```yaml
generation:
  routes:
    enabled: true
    output_file: "routes_gen.go"
  dependencies:
    enabled: true
    output_file: "dependencies_gen.go"
```

### Custom Output Files

If you've configured custom output file names, the clean command will remove those files:

```yaml
generation:
  routes:
    output_file: "my_routes.go"      # Will remove my_routes.go
  dependencies:
    output_file: "my_deps.go"        # Will remove my_deps.go
```

## Safety Features

### File Validation

The clean command only removes files that match the configured output file names. It won't accidentally delete:

- Source code files
- Configuration files
- Documentation files
- Any other project files

### Dry Run Mode

While not currently implemented, future versions may include a dry-run mode to preview what would be deleted:

```bash
taskw clean --dry-run
```

## Common Use Cases

### Regenerating Code

```bash
# Clean existing generated files
taskw clean

# Generate fresh code
taskw generate
```

### Switching Configurations

```bash
# Clean current configuration
taskw clean

# Update taskw.yaml
# ... edit configuration ...

# Generate with new configuration
taskw generate
```

### Debugging Generation Issues

```bash
# Clean all generated files
taskw clean

# Scan to verify configuration
taskw scan

# Generate step by step
taskw generate routes
taskw generate deps
```

### Version Control

Remove generated files before committing:

```bash
# Clean generated files
taskw clean

# Add source files to git
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Update handlers and providers"
```

## Integration with Other Commands

### Clean and Generate Workflow

```bash
# Complete regeneration workflow
taskw clean
taskw scan
taskw generate
```

### Clean and Init Workflow

```bash
# Clean existing project
taskw clean

# Initialize new project structure
taskw init github.com/user/new-project
```

## Error Handling

The clean command handles various scenarios gracefully:

### File System Errors

- **Permission Denied** - Reports error but continues with other files
- **File Not Found** - Skips missing files (not an error)
- **Directory Issues** - Reports configuration problems

### Configuration Errors

- **Invalid Output Paths** - Reports configuration issues
- **Missing Configuration** - Uses default file names

## Exit Codes

- `0` - Clean completed successfully
- `1` - Clean failed due to errors
- `2` - Configuration error

## Performance

The clean command is very fast as it only needs to:

- Read configuration
- Check file existence
- Remove files

For typical projects, the clean command completes in milliseconds.

## Best Practices

### Regular Cleanup

Clean generated files regularly to avoid confusion:

```bash
# Before major changes
taskw clean

# After switching branches
taskw clean
taskw generate
```

### Version Control

Don't commit generated files to version control:

```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo "routes_gen.go" >> .gitignore
echo "dependencies_gen.go" >> .gitignore
echo "swagger.json" >> .gitignore
```

### CI/CD Integration

Use clean in your build pipeline:

```yaml
# In your CI configuration
- name: Clean generated files
  run: taskw clean

- name: Generate code
  run: taskw generate

- name: Build project
  run: go build ./...
```
